FabLabNeukoelln-Fungi_Project

A way to live sustainable. 
Substrate can be a mix of cardboard and saw dust or coffee ground. (Would need to be sterile though.

Learn and start a business or feed your school. :)

# Where?
In the storage room of the fablab/42Berlin school

# Outline
create an temperature and humidity controlled environment to grow mushrooms.

## phases
### build a martha tent 
- a design structure, a ftame to support the shelves. Metall frame made of pipes and joints would be better I think
- shelves will be made of metal mesh or some can use bars. They can be removed.
- there will be a transparent cover with a zip. it can be made modular. If we get the material we should be able to
  saw the zip together. Or maybe make a left side. the zip and the right side.. which can be extensed by putting a part in the middle?

### vents
- air filter in with fan?
- air vent out with fan.
- humidifier
- light and heatbody

### some controllers
- measure the CO2. the humidity and the temp. so three elements to connect to a board
- arduino to handle the three elements. a display and input knobs?
- rapsberry pie to connect to web? maybe home kit. control heating for temp, fan for co2 etc 

### mix the substrate
- coffee grounds
- wood pellets
- big container
- plastic mushrooms growing bags to hang 
- mix the pellets with the spawn. put in bags - 3 weeks wait at 20-24 C for oysters
- 125 kg per sq mt
- dark environment
