FabLabNeukoelln-Fungi_Project

A way to live sustainably. Substrate can be a mix of cardboard and sawdust or coffee grounds. (Would need to be sterile though.)

Learn and start a business or feed your school. :)

# Where?
In the basement or storage room of the NK_fablab/42Berlin school.

# Outline
Create a temperature and humidity controlled environment to grow mushrooms.

## Phases
### Build a small "Martha" tent or a smaller proof of concept one-bag environment.
- Design structure, a frame to support the shelves. A metal frame made of pipes and joints would be good, but wooden shelves would also be nice.
- Shelves can have metal mesh or some can use bars or have wooden support. They can be removed.
- There will be a transparent cover with a zip. It can be made modular. If we get the material we should be able to saw the zip together.

## Lights
Depends on the mushroom type. LED with either red or blue frequency and timer. Some mushrooms are happy with 12 hrs a day. Fruiting is red light and spawning is blue usually.

### Ventilation
- Air filter in with fan?
- Air vent out with fan.

#### Sensors
- Humidity sensor. The most common temperature and humidity sensor for Arduino is the DHT series, specifically the DHT11 or DHT22.
- CO2 - Fungi don't like high CO2 content.
- Temperature needs to be between 22-28°C for oyster mushrooms.

### Some Microcontrollers
- Arduino can handle the three sensors. Can send data via WiFi?

## Music?
Can mushrooms make music? This is still left to see.

### Mix the Substrate
- Coffee grounds
- Wood pellets
- Big container
- Plastic mushroom growing bags to hang
- Mix the pellets with the spawn. Put in bags - 3 weeks wait at 20-24°C for oysters.
- 125 kg per sq m
- Dark environment
